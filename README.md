## Comments

I name project NodesTask. For release to fictive client I rename project Yoyo Cinema and change images. For create precise UI, I need have design.

I used simple UX. With dividing functionality to two sections. 

First section is for search of movie. User need to be online. The is possibility update functionality to handle connection error better. This section also contains sorting options.

Second section if online to show saved favourites movies. One way to update this is save image date to CoreData. Now it is only thing, which is loaded from internet.

Detail of movie is same for each section. It showing detail information of movie. User need to be connected to internet to show this screen.
